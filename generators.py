# A generator is a function that, unlike a regular function that
# always forgets what it has done and starts from beginning each
# time it is called, a generator remembers where it left off and
# continues from there at the next call. In Python, generators
# are an easy way to define lazy sequences that produce their
# elements one element at the time, only doing any work when
# actually asked to do so.

# There is nothing in the laws of nature or man that says that
# a lazy sequence could not just as well be infinite. The users
# of that sequence can (and always should) decorate it with
# itertools.islice to extract the finite prefix instead of
# using more low-level old-timey and non-Pythonic techniques.

# To get started, the classic chestnut of Fibonacci numbers.
# It's like that one is a law of some sorts for CS instructors.

# Theon's Ladder, devised by Theon of Smyrna (ca. 140 B.C), is a series
# of rational numbers that converge to square root of two. Then after
# two millenia, Shaun Giberson and Thomas J. Osler proved in 2013 that
# the method generalizes for the square roots of any integer c. Since
# outside actual math courses it is pretty rare to need any mathematics
# that was not old news to the mathematicians in the 19th century, we
# should latch onto this rare chance to examine something that was
# missed for so long. This generator produces two-tuples (a, b) that
# denote the numerator and denominator of that fraction.

# quadrant of pairs (a, b) where a and b are natural numbers,

# that your code is looking for. Use the all_pairs generator
# to systematically sweep through this infinite plane until
# you find the (a, b) that is closest to origin (0, 0).
